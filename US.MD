# Currency Converter


## Description
This project is designed to be used in telegram as a bot. With the help of this bot you can now easily in a short time to know the exchange rate in other countries, for example - you have 100 rubles and you want to know how much it is in USD (dollars).


## Installing

Download the necessary files, then use ¿¹³pip¹¹¹¹ (or ¹³pip3£ if conflict with Python2) to set dependencies. You can also set dependencies by using the command below:



messing with
pip install requirements.txt
messing with


## Environment variables
Part of the project is built on environment variables. Environment variables are similar to variables in programming languages. They exist as part of a running command interpreter session, that is, variables will disappear when the terminal closes. They load there during its initialization, although this is not the only way they appear.
The env (environment) command can be used to view the set variables.

An example of the content of the file ¿.env¹:


messing with
TG_CHAT_ID = "dasdsadjsandsamdnsajdhsaj123mdsandmsan"
TOKEN_TG = "sakdsmakqwheudsajkdjakdasj@mdnsamdnaj"

## Run Script

You must already have Python3 installed to run the script.

To get the necessary books and images you need to write in the terminal:

messing with
python main.py 
messing with

Then go into the telegram, and enter into your bot, which you have already created in the bot under id - ː ª@BotFather ː. Write to the chat bot command,  [/ start[ī ī ī, if you need help on how the script works press the button ¿ī ī í ª Help ș ī ī, if you need to convert currency click on the button ¿ó ó Convert currencies³³


For successful use, I hope you will find application to this script, or do something with it further and more.
